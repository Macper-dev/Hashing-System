### Hashing System
The source is a hundred percent programmed by Macper.
Please contact me on discord: Macper#1000 for support.
You could optionally used this to store data inside of a Growtopia Private Server.
Which is not what It's meant for but could be useful.
The source is split into 2 parts meaning one to store user input, and then the hashing code.

### Requirements
- Optional but Recommended IDE: Visual Studio 2022 with C++ Desktop Development

### Updates
- Seperate hashes for Mail and Password
